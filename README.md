# 🏨 Hotel Price Estimation

This project estimates hotel prices based on location and optional features using machine learning.

## ⚙️ Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data_processing.py` | Prepares and processes input data for modeling |
| `Untitled.ipynb` | Exploratory data analysis and model building |
| `api.py` | Wraps the trained model in an API for price prediction |
| `test.py` | Example script to test price prediction functionality |

## 🚀 Usage

1. Prepare data and train model via the notebook or `data_processing.py`.  
2. Serve the model through `api.py`.  
3. Run predictions using `test.py` or via the API endpoint.

## 🛠 Tools

Python, scikit-learn, Flask (or similar web framework)

## ✅ Outcomes

- Trained regression model for hotel price prediction  
- API interface for external price prediction calls  
- Basic test setup for validating predictions
